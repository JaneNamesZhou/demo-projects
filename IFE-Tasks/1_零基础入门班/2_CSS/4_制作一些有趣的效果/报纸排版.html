        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having
        little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
        shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
        the
        world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
        circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
        whenever
        it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
        involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
        of
        every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper
        hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
        deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's
        hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.
        This
        is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato
        throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is
        nothing
        surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree,
        some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the
        ocean
        with me.

        There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
        wharves as
        Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right
        and
        left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the
        battery,
        where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a
        few
        hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of
        water-gazers
        there.
