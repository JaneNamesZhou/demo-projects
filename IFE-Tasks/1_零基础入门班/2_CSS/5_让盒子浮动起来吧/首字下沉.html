        <p>
            I am in the Great Sahara Desert for the third <br>
            sundown in a row.
            Fouad and I
            pass back and <br> forth a sun-bleached map of the stars. It’s more <br> of a
            tug-of-war
            to be honest. With what remains <br> of the daylight, we commit to memory
            the <br>
            positions of spots on the page. We hope to find some <br> correlation in
            its
            negative, which slides overhead as <br> the sun rapidly dies.
